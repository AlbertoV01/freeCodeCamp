            <h2>Salvador Sánchez Narvaez</h2>
            <p id="tribute-info">  <a id="tribute-link" href="https://boxrec.com/en/box-pro/2201" target="_blank">Salvador Sánchez</a> was a Mexican professional boxer born on January 26, 1959, in Santiago Tianguistenco, Estado de México. He became one of the greatest featherweight champions in boxing history, known for his incredible speed, endurance, and technical skills.
                Sánchez began his professional career at a young age and quickly rose through the ranks. In 1980, he won the WBC featherweight title by defeating  <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Lopez_(boxer)" target="_blank"> Danny "Little Red" Lopez</a>. He successfully defended his title multiple times, including a famous victory against <a id="tribute-link" href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfredo_G%C3%B3mez" target="_blank">Wilfredo Gómez</a>, a previously undefeated Puerto Rican champion.
                Despite his promising career, Sánchez's life was tragically cut short. On August 12, 1982, at just 23 years old, he died in a car accident in Querétaro, Mexico. His untimely death left boxing fans wondering how much more he could have achieved.
                In 1991, Salvador Sánchez was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame, cementing his legacy as one of the greatest featherweight boxers of all time
